My try to understand the Book Clean Coding, and use the Prinziples to get the code better Readeable and to better Maintain it. 


The Rules i Tryd to impliment, are 


1. Clarity Ober Brevity: Code Should be Easy Readable. Avoding Complex Structurs
2. Meaningful Names: Variable, Functions, Class Names need Names that clearly express their purpose.
3. Functions Should be Small: Each Function Should Perform a Single Task
4. Consistent Formatting: Consisntent Formatting significantly improves readabillity
5. Use Comments Sparingly: Comments most of the time dont Help making the Code Readable, Code should be largely self-Explaining
6. Avoid Duplicated Code: Do not repeat  Code in mulitple places. Instead, extraxt recurring logic into Functions
7. Use Exceptions for Error Handling: Use exceptions to handlee Errors Clearly and Consinstenly.
8. Testabillity: Write Code that is Easy to Test.
9. Object and Data Structures: Choose appropriate Data structures for your Task
10. Avoid Unnecessary Abstractions: Add abstractions only where they are truly needed.
